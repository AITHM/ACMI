Objective: 

We explored a feasible range of non-pharmaceutical interventions aimed to control a continuing outbreak of the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Sydney, Australia.

Findings: 

The level of social distancing currently attained in Sydney is inadequate for the outbreak control. A counter-factual analysis suggested that if 80% of agents comply with social distancing, then at least a month is needed for the new daily cases to reduce from their peak to below ten, while 70% compliance lengthens this period to 45 days.
Comparison: to discuss
