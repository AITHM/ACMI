Objectives: 

Despite the strong restrictions in New South Wales, particularly in those Local Government Authorities (LGAs) of concern, COVID-19 case numbers are still growing exponentially at five per cent a day.
This modelling study seeks to estimate the time required to reach ≤5 cases per day under three lockdown strengths (weak, moderate, strong), and four vaccination rollouts: (a) per the original plan, (b) prioritizing essential workers, (c) b plus rapid vaccination of 25% of <60-year-olds with AstraZeneca (AZ25), and (d) b plus rapid vaccination of 50% of <60-year-olds with AstraZeneca (AZ50). We estimate the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the 100 days after the 1st of August, 2021, for these 12 scenarios.

Findings: 

The business-as-usual rollout fully vaccinates 50%, 70% and 80% of >16-year-olds by 10/Oct, 21/Nov,
and 28/Dec, respectively. This reduced to 1 Oct, 30 Oct, and 22 Nov for the fastest (AZ50) rollout.
A strong lockdown with a rapid vaccine rollout was the fastest to reach ≤5 cases (14-day average), with a
median of 78 days (90% Uncertainty interval 61 - 103) or 18 Oct, compared to 207 days (166 - 254) or
24 Feb for a weak lockdown with no rollout acceleration. Increased lockdown strength had more impact
than rollout acceleration.
Under the AZ25 vaccination scenario, there were 1,440 (90% UI 262 - 10,600 deaths in the first 100 days
of cases under a weak lockdown, compared to 71 (90% UI 26 - 178) under a strong lockdown scenario.
