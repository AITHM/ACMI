Objective: 

To gain an understanding of how to ease social distancing measures to prevent a rebound in cases and deaths in locations with either a high numbers of daily cases or limited ongoing transmission.

Findings:

* In countries where strong social distancing measures were activated after the COVID-19 virus had spread widely, it was found that these measures are required to be maintained for significant periods before being eased in order to return to a situation where daily case numbers become low
* In countries where early responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been highly successful, as in Australia, it is shown that a staged relaxation of social distancing prevents a rebound in cases
