Objective: 

In this viewpoint article we aimed to outline and describe a collaborative modelling approach between our unit and a range of partners across the Western Pacific in the Philippines, Malaysia and Viet Nam. The work focused on providing real-time modelling projections to support to policy and public health decisions in each country.

Findings: 

The important findings from this reflection include demonstrating the capacity to develop real-time COVID-19 modelling in low- and middle-income countries that had tangible impact to support policy decisions, the importance of close in-country partnerships required to undertake such work when providing support from an external country and strengthening partnerships across the Western Pacific that may help build capacity to respond to infectious disease threats.
