Objective: 

 Model projections based on the virus’s infectiousness demonstrated its pandemic potential, which guided the global response to and prepared countries for increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Tracking the impact of distancing and movement policies and behaviour changes has been critical in evaluating these decisions.

Findings: 

* Modelling COVID-19 influenced policy at all stages of the outbreak.
* Greater synthesis of epidemiological models and economic models is needed to assist policy makers.
* Models must be adapted to context, both in terms of disease behaviour and different interventions in different countries.
