Objective: 

Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following vaccination wanes over time in a non-linear fashion, making modelling of likely population impacts of COVID-19 policy options challenging. We observed that it was possible to mathematize non-linear waning of vaccine effectiveness (VE) on the percentage scale as linear waning on the log-odds scale, and developed a random effects logistic regression equation based on UK Health Security Agency data to model VE against Omicron following two and three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Findings: 

Vaccine effectiveness on the odds scale reduced by 47% per month for symptomatic infection after
two vaccine doses, lessening to 35% per month for hospitalisation. Waning on the odds scale after triple
dose vaccines was 35% per month for symptomatic disease and 19% for hospitalisation.
