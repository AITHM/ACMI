Objective: 

To compare the effects of alternative social distancing strategies upon the duration, rate of growth in cases, and the magnitude of the epidemic peak in an outbreak.

Findings:

* The application of all four social distancing interventions: school closure, workplace non-attendance, increased case isolation, and community contact reduction is highly effective in flattening the epidemic curve, reducing the maximum daily case numbers, and lengthening outbreak duration
* The application of these same interventions were also found to be effective even after 10 weeks delay from index case arrivals
* The most effective single intervention was found to be increasing case isolation, to 100% of children and 90% of adults
