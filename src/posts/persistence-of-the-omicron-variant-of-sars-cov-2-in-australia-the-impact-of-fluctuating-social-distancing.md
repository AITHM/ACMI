Objective: 

We modelled emergence and spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Australia between December 2021 and June 2022: a pandemic stage which exhibited recurrent waves and a diverse epidemiological profile with emergence of co-circulating sub-lineages of Omicron. 

Findings: 

Our study revealed that the nonlinear dynamics observed in the daily incidence and disease burden were determined not only by introduction of sub-lineages of Omicron, but also by fluctuations in social distancing behaviour. The analysis also quantified and emphasised indirect effects of COVID-19 on the disease burden in Australia, differentiating between ICU cases and deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 versus those occurring with COVID-19.
