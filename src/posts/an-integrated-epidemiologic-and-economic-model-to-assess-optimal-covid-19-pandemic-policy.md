preview: Identifying optimal COVID-19 policies is challenging. Therefore,
  COVID-19-related policy decisions must be made in the context of substantial
  uncertainty, a significant challenge for policy makers. In this complex
  environment it is increasingly important that the benefits and drawbacks of
  interventions are rigorously and systematically compared – including from a
  cost effectiveness perspective

Objective: 

In this study, we used an agent-based model to estimate morbidity, mortality, and costs over an 18-month period beginning 1 April 2022 for each scenario. Policy options were ranked on cost-effectiveness (health system only and health system plus GDP perspectives), deaths and days exceeding hospital occupancy thresholds.

Findings: 

The median number of infections across the 44 policies was 6.2 million (range of medians 5.4 to 7.1 million). Higher stringency PHSMs ranked better from a health system perspective, but not a health system plus GDP perspective. The provision of respirators had minimal impact. Vaccinating all age groups was superior to both no further vaccination and targeted vaccination of individuals aged ≥ 60 years. The optimal combined policy was the rollout of a multivalent vaccine to all age groups with higher stringency PHSMs and no respirator provision.
