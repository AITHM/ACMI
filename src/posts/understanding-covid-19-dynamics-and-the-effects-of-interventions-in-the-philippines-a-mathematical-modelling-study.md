preview: COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact
  structure, mobility, and Minimum Health Standards (MHS) adherence. Continued
  compliance with low-cost MHS should help the Philippines control the epidemic
  until vaccines are widely distributed, but disease resurgence may be occurring
  due to a combination of low population immunity and detection rates and new
  variants of concern.

Objective: 

COVID-19 initially caused less severe outbreaks in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with many high-income countries, possibly because of differing demographics, socioeconomics, surveillance, and policy responses. Here, we investigate the role of multiple factors on COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines, a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak.

Findings: 

Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 13-27%. The February 2021 case detection rate was estimated at \~8%, population recovered at \~9%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence.
