Objective: 

To estimate whether the ‘Stage 3’ and ‘Stage 4’ restriction levels used in the Victorian second wave would be sufficient to control the Delta outbreak in NSW when it was at 30 cases/day

Findings:

* NSW’s updated restrictions (introduced 9 July 2021) are approximately equivalent to Victoria’s Stage 3 + masks restrictions.
* Stage 3 + masks restrictions were found to prevent daily case numbers from increasing further, but are unlikely to be sufficient to eliminate community transmission in an acceptable amount of time.
* Victoria’s Stage 4 restrictions are likely to contain a Delta variant outbreak
Contrasting: These findings were in agreement with other modelling groups at the time of release. The epidemic and restriction levels in NSW has since changed from the scenarios modelled.
