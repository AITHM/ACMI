Objective: 

With the promise of efficacious new vaccines, mitigation is appropriately not considered as part of Australia’s national strategy. However, our stated goal of achieving “no community transmission” remains poorly defined and risks missing important distinctions between elimination and suppression

Findings: 

The rapid spread of the virus necessitates a public health strategy that is clear, robust and agile. Improved control combined with the increasingly clear seasonality of the virus[5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.5694/mja2.50894#mja250894-bib-0005) suggest that control can be maintained throughout the summer. However, if vaccination has not been widely distributed before winter 2021 and we do not make clear choices, further major outbreaks remain likely.
