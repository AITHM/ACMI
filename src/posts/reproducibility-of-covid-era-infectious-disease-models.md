preview: Computational reproducibility is an important part of any computational
  science as the paper is typically a summarised version of the experiments with
  the traditional methods section insufficient for a reader to reproduce the
  results. Often, critical details relating to data pre-processing through to
  simulation are described imprecisely, and can only be uncovered by analysing
  code.

Objective: 

To assess the computational reproducibility of COVID-19 infectious disease modeling articles due to their potential significance and translational impact. 

Findings:

* 88 out of 100 randomly sampled studies Infectious disease models were not computationally reproducible.
* 67 out of 100 top cited Infectious disease models were not computationally reproducible.
* Journals mandating data release are significantly associated with code release.
