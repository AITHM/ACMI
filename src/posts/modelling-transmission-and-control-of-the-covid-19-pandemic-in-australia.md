Objective: 

We compared various mitigation and suppression strategies aimed to control the initial pandemic wave of COVID-19 in Australia, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures.

Findings: 

We reported several trade-offs, and an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels, with compliance at the 90% level found to control the disease within 13â€“14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions. School closures were not found to bring decisive benefits unless complemented with high level of social distancing compliance.
