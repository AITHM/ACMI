overview: >-
  [COVID-19 Modelling Aotearoa](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz/covid-19/) is
  a cross-organisation and transdisciplinary group of academic researchers and
  scientists that were brought together by [Te Pūnaha
  Matatini](https://www.tepunahamatatini.ac.nz) to help Aotearoa New Zealand
  face the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Our work is underpinned by Te Tiriti o Waitangi, fast and committed peer review, and ethics. These parameters ensure that the modelling developed by our broad team is uniquely equipped to provide scientifically robust results which are fit for Aotearoa New Zealand and support our decision-making.
