overview: "The COVID policy modelling group was established in early 2020 to
  model to explore key public policy questions in relation to COVID-19. The
  modelling group has: analysed Australia's first wave and the public health and
  economic consequences of delayed suppression; the public health outcomes of
  alternative (duration and stringency) of public health measures in response to
  Australia's second (Victorian) wave;  a statistical method to determine the
  true (population) infection rate for COVID-19; comparsison of the public
  health outcomes in Nordic countries in 2020; and the possible morbidities and
  mortalities associated with Phase D of the National Plan to transition
  Australia's response to COVID-19."

The COVID policy modelling group was established in early 2020 to model and explore key public policy questions in relation to COVID-19. The modelling group has: analysed Australia's first wave and the public health and economic consequences of delayed suppression; explored the public health outcomes of alternative (duration and stringency) public health measures in response to Australia's second (Victorian) wave;  developed a statistical method to determine the true (population) infection rate for COVID-19; performed a comparison of the public health outcomes in Nordic countries in 2020; and modelled the possible morbidities and mortalities associated with Phase D of the National Plan to transition Australia's response to COVID-19.
