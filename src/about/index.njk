		<h4>Our story</h4>
		The Australian COVID-19 Modelling Initiative (ACMI) comprises several research groups, and aims to facilitate a rapid access to a collection of COVID-19 modelling studies, in an easy to find and understand format, for the public and policy makers.  
		<div class="par-br"></div>		

		<h4>Our aims</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Showcase modelling by independent academic groups, centres and institutes, across the country</li>
			<li>Make COVID-19 modelling more transparent and available for the public and policy makers </li>
			<li>Facilitate the comparison of modelling approaches and outcomes</li>
			<li>Draw attention both to when modelling results agree (lending greater confidence to policymaking) and disagree (suggesting the need for more deliberation among modelling groups, and caution required by policymakers) </li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Contributing to the initiative</h4>
		The ACMI is a collaborative venture, and we welcome contributions from academic research groups that actively engage in COVID-19 modelling research. If you are interested in contributing your research to the initiative and satisfy the critera below, <a href="mailto:populationinterventions@unimelb.edu.au?subject=Contribution enquiry">we would love to hear from you</a>.
