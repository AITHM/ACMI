title: Australian COVID-19 Modelling Initiative (AUSCMI) submission to the
  Australian COVID-19 Response Inquiry
date: 2024-02-09T04:46:53.442Z
preview: "AUSCMI is a broad collective of expert researchers, epidemiologists,
  and modellers focused on modelling infectious diseases dynamics that is not
  formally constituted. We met throughout the pandemic to support coordination
  of Australian COVID-19 modelling for policy and disseminated our modelling
  research through various modalities, including a series of educational
  seminars to improve community understanding of infectious disease modelling.
  Our submission focuses on the role, impact and potential of modelling in
  policy, strategy and research. We provide related recommendations for
  improving Australia's preparedness for future pandemics. We note that several
  very important modelling-related issues fall out of scope of the review terms
  of reference, including sub-national and international coordination and long
  Covid. Details of the Submission can be found in the link below:"
